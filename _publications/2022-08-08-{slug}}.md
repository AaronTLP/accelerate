title: Neural network approximations for Calabi-Yau metrics
abstract: Ricci flat metrics for Calabi-Yau threefolds are not known
  analytically. In this work, we employ techniques from machine learning to
  deduce numerical flat metrics for K3, the Fermat quintic, and the Dwork
  quintic. This investigation employs a simple, modular neural network
  architecture that is capable of approximating Ricci flat Kähler metrics for
  Calabi-Yau manifolds of dimensions two and three. We show that measures that
  assess the Ricci flatness and consistency of the metric decrease after
  training. This improvement is corroborated by the performance of the trained
  network on an independent validation set. Finally, we demonstrate the
  consistency of the learnt metric by showing that it is invariant under the
  discrete symmetries it is expected to possess.
