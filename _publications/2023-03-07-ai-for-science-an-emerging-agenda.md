title: "AI for Science: An Emerging Agenda"
abstract: >-
  This report documents the programme and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 22382
  "Machine Learning for Science: Bridging Data-Driven and Mechanistic
  Modelling". Today's scientific challenges are characterised by complexity.
  Interconnected natural, technological, and human systems are influenced by
  forces acting across time- and spatial-scales, resulting in complex
  interactions and emergent behaviours. Understanding these phenomena -- and
  leveraging scientific advances to deliver innovative solutions to improve
  society's health, wealth, and well-being -- requires new ways of analysing
  complex systems. The transformative potential of AI stems from its widespread
  applicability across disciplines, and will only be achieved through
  integration across research domains. AI for science is a rendezvous point. It
  brings together expertise from AI and application domains; combines modelling
  knowledge with engineering know-how; and relies on collaboration across
  disciplines and between humans and machines. Alongside technical advances, the
  next wave of progress in the field will come from building a community of
  machine learning researchers, domain experts, citizen scientists, and
  engineers working together to design and deploy effective AI tools. This
  report summarises the discussions from the seminar and provides a roadmap to
  suggest how different communities can collaborate to deliver a new wave of
  progress in AI and its application for scientific discovery.
