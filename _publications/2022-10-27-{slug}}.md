title: "Software Application Profile: ShinyDataSHIELD—an R Shiny application to
  perform federated non-disclosive data analysis in multicohort studies"
abstract: >-
  **Motivation**


  DataSHIELD is an open-source software infrastructure enabling the analysis of data distributed across multiple databases (federated data) without leaking individuals’ information (non-disclosive). It has applications in many scientific domains, ranging from biosciences to social sciences and including high-throughput genomic studies. R is the language used to interact with (and build) DataSHIELD. This creates difficulties for researchers who do not have experience writing R code or lack the time to learn how to use the DataSHIELD functions. To help new researchers use the DataSHIELD infrastructure and to improve the user-friendliness for experienced researchers, we present ShinyDataSHIELD.


  **Implementation**


  ShinyDataSHIELD is a web application with an R backend that serves as a graphical user interface (GUI) to the DataSHIELD infrastructure.


  **General features**


  The version of the application presented here includes modules to perform: (i) exploratory analysis through descriptive summary statistics and graphical representations (scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps and boxplots); (ii) statistical modelling (generalized linear fixed and mixed-effects models, survival analysis through Cox regression); (iii) genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and (iv) omic analysis (transcriptomics, epigenomics and multi-omic integration).


  **Availability**
