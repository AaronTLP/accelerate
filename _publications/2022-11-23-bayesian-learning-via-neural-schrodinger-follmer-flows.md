title: Bayesian learning via neural Schrödinger–Föllmer flows
abstract: In this work we explore a new framework for approximate Bayesian
  inference in large datasets based on stochastic control. We advocate
  stochastic control as a finite time and low variance alternative to popular
  steady-state methods such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.
  Furthermore, we discuss and adapt the existing theoretical guarantees of this
  framework and establish connections to already existing VI routines in
  SDE-based models.
