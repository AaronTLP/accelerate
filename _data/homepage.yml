        ### Amidst growing excitement about AI, a gap has emerged between our
        aspirations for AI and our ability to deploy these technologies to
        tackle real-world challenges.


        ML@CL aims to bridge this gap through innovations in modelling, systems and software engineering for machine learning deployment; the application of AI for scientific discovery; and the development of policy frameworks for trustworthy and beneficial AI.
