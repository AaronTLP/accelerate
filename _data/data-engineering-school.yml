    This course will introduce the foundational principles and methods in data
    engineering that researchers need to make use of AI. Blending online
    lectures and practical labs, with a focus on the principles of data science
    and case studies of their application in science, this Winter School will
    provide participants with hands-on experience of data science for science.


    Further details about content and how to apply to join the course will follow in October 2022.
