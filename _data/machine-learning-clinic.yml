  heading: Welcome to the Accelerate Science Machine Learning Engineering Clinic!
  content: >-
    This new initiative seeks to support Cambridge University researchers using
    AI in their research, by helping resolve engineering issues they might
    encounter when implementing machine learning methods.


    Software engineering queries can arise across the research pipeline, from writing proposals to implementing and deploying models, and the Clinic will provide support to troubleshoot those issues.


    When you contact the Clinic, an experienced Engineer can offer advice or guidance on how to resolve your query. Simply log your issue via the Clinic's form and one of the Clinic's engineers will follow-up to arrange a meeting to either further discuss the issue if needed or to discuss a potential solution.


    Log your issues at the ML Engineering Clinic's form and we will get back to you soon!


    For further information about how to engage with the Clinic, and what support is on offer, please read the FAQs below.
