### FEBRUARY/MARCH 2023 DATA SCIENCE FOR SCIENCE RESIDENCY - APPLICATIONS OPEN

**PhD students and postdocs across Cambridge University can apply for this training course, which will equip them will skills in data science for science.**

Aimed at helping participants apply data science tools to their own datasets and research problems, the course runs over five weeks, starting on 27 February 2023. Previous courses have attracted participants from fields including chemistry, biochemistry, physics, engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine and psychology. Applications for the next course are open until **5pm on Friday 13 January.** \
\
**What does the course cover?**\
\
The course aims to give researchers in fields outside computer science the skills they need to use machine learning (ML) in their research, and help them apply data analysis to their own datasets and problems. On the course, you will: use data science techniques on your own datasets and research questions; collaborate on real-world data science challenges in teams; and contribute to a world-leading community of scientists and researchers. You can read more about how some of our recent participants has used the course to advance their work in the ‘How can I..?’ series on [Accelerate’s blog](https://acceleratescience.github.io/blog).

Recent participants also share their experiences of the course in a short video available here. 

Residents will cover 6 modules over a period of 5 weeks:

* Introduction to Python (preparatory module)
* Data Processing with Pandas
* Data Visualisation
* Web Scraping, JSON and APIs
* Introduction to machine learning
* Project & presentation

**How do I apply?** 

Candidates should complete the application form (at this link: <https://forms.office.com/e/EYhqCFGQqz>) by **5pm on 13 January**.  After completing the application form, candidates will be asked to complete a short programming exercise, which is intended to give a sense of their current programming abilities. This exercise will take approximately three hours to complete. Further details will be emailed to candidates on 16 January, and you will have approx. 2 weeks to complete the exercise.

Candidates should ensure their supervisors or managers are content for them to join the course before applying and should be prepared to commit to participating in course activities between 27 February and 31 March. Candidates should also confirm they have 50% funding towards the cost of the course (£1,050 + VAT), with the other 50% being funded by the Accelerate Programme. 

To access the application form, please log-in with your @cam.ac.uk email address. If you are a member of the University or an affiliated institution, but don’t have an @cam.ac.uk email account, please contact accelerate-science@cst.cam.ac.uk 

**What are the entry requirements?**

Participants should be current PhD students or researchers at the University of Cambridge and have basic programming skills (e.g. the ability to use Excel, MATLAB, R or Python). Participants should be available from 27 February– 31 March 2023 and can expect to spend 30 hours on the programme each week, including timetabled sessions and periods of independent study.

Completion of the [Python for Science module](https://acceleratescience.github.io/resources/python-programming-for-science.html) is not a pre-requisite for this course, as participants will receive training in the use of Python. However, applicants are required to complete an assessment to demonstrate basic programming skills.

**How is the course delivered?**

To produce this course, the Accelerate Programme is working with Cambridge Spark, an education technology company that specialises in data science and AI training. For further information about Cambridge Spark, please see: [https://cambridgespark.com/about/ ](https://cambridgespark.com/about/)

The course will be run via Zoom, with sessions delivered by Cambridge Spark and their community of mentors.

**How much does the course cost?**
The course costs £2,100 + VAT per participant. For this cohort, the Accelerate Programme are able to offer 50% funding towards the cost, meaning the cost will be available to participants for £1,050 + VAT.

For further questions, please contact accelerate-science@cst.cam.ac.uk.
