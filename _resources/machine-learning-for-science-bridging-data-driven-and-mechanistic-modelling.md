In September 2022, Accelerate Science, with collaborators at the University of Tuebingen and University of Wisconsin Madison, convened 30 researchers from across disciplines at a Dagstuhl workshop on ‘Machine learning for science: bridging data-driven and mechanistic modelling’. Two outputs emerged from these discussions:

* A research agenda that identifies areas where further technology development is needed to create AI tools that can enhance scientific discovery; and
* A roadmap for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to deliver a new wave of progress in AI and its application for scientific discovery.

*A﻿I for Science: An emerging agenda*, the report outlining this emerging agenda and roadmap is available [here](https://acceleratescience.github.io/assets/uploads/ai-for-science-an-emerging-agenda.pdf)and on arXiv:
