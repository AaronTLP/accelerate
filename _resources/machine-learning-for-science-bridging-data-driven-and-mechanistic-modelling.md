In September 2022, Accelerate Science, with collaborators at the University of Tuebingen and University of Wisconsin Madison, convened 30 researchers from across disciplines at a Dagstuhl workshop on ‘Machine learning for science: bridging data-driven and mechanistic modelling’. Two outputs emerged from these discussions:

* A research agenda that identifies areas where further technology development is needed to create AI tools that can enhance scientific discovery; and
* A roadmap for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to deliver a new wave of progress in AI and its application for scientific discovery.

You can view a graphic summary of discussions [here]('https://acceleratescience.github.io/assets/uploads/2022-12-15-dagstuhl-ml-for-science-final-ipdfpdf.pdf).

Further outputs from these discussions will be posted here in early 2023.
