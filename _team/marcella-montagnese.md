  My main area of theoretical interest is reality distortion in psychosis and
  its underlying neurocognitive and physiological mechanisms. My current work
  focuses on the application of computational models of reinforcement learning
  (RL) in patients with schizophrenia, in addition to investigating the link
  between RL task performance and molecular genetic risk for the disorder.


  I am also interested in studying psychosis across different disorders, specifically Parkinson's disease.
