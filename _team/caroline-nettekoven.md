biography: Caro is a neuroscientist interested in how different brain regions
  work together to achieve complex behaviours. She also studies how disrupted
  communication between brain regions leads to disordered behaviour and has a
  particular interest in the cerebellum. During her time in the group, she
  worked on new NLP techniques to capture altered patterns of language use in
  mental health conditions.
