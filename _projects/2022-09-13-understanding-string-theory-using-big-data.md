Led by Dr Challenger Mishra, this theoretical physics-focused team works on the long-standing problem of quantising gravity. Using machine learning as a tool to understand String Theory as a problem in big data, it analyses various aspects of the complex geometries that feature in String Theory, using the tools of differential and algebraic-geometry. Team members also pursue wider interests in fundamental physical processes and the development of machine learning theory and methods to understand them.
