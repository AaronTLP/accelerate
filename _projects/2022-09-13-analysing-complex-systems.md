### Complex systems are all around us, from social networks to transportation systems, cities, economies, and financial markets. Through collaborations with domain experts in finance, healthcare, immunology, virology, and cell biology, Dr Soumya Banerjee develops computational techniques that can be deployed to better understand complex systems. This work implements new statistical and machine learning techniques for deriving insights from large amounts of data, with a focus on building interdisciplinary collaborations, in particular with experimentalists and clinicians.Â 

A current area of interest is working with clinicians and patients, engaging patient groups and the public in discussions about trust in AI. This contributes to wider interests in outreach and public dialogue.
