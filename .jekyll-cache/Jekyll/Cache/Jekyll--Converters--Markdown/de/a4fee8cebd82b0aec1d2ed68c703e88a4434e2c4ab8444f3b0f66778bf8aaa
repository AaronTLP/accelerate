I"‰<p>Challenger is developing machine-driven approaches to problems in String Theory and related Calabi-Yau geometries, studying the vast landscape of String Theory solutions using a combination of tools and techniques from machine learning and mathematical physics. His work seeks to deepen understandings of the map between String Theory models and the Standard Model of particle physics.</p>
