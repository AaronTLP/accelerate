I"m<p>Cilie is a Ph.D. candidate visiting from the Technical University of Denmark and she is particularly interested in the geometry of probabilistic latent variable models and uncertainty quantification. Currently, she is working with my host-supervisor Professor Neil Lawrence on developing a prior for the latent variables to incorporate Bayesian differential geometry in the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. In Denmark, she is supervised by Professors Lars Kai Hansen and Søren Hauberg and jointly, they are working on invariant probabilistic latent representations under symmetric transformations. She received my Master’s degree in Physics from the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen in Denmark and before starting her PhD studies, she worked for three years with data analysis of clinical trials in a large pharmaceutical company (Novo Nordisk).</p>
