I"ù<p>Real-world data typically contain a large number of features that
are often heterogeneous in nature, relevance, and also units of
measure. When assessing the similarity between data points, one can
build various distance measures using subsets of these
features. Using the fewest features but still retaining sufficient
information about the system is crucial in many statistical learning
approaches, particularly when data are sparse. We introduce a
statistical test that can assess the relative information retained
when using two different distance measures, and determine if they
are equivalent, independent, or if one is more informative than the
other. This in turn allows finding the most informative distance
measure out of a pool of candidates. The approach is applied to find
the most relevant policy variables for controlling the Covid-19
epidemic and to find compact yet informative representations of
atomic structures, but its potential applications are wide ranging
in many branches of science.</p>
