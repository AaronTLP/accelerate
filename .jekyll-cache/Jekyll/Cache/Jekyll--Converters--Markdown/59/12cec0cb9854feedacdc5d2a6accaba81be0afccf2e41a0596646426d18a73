I"+<p>Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVM) are used to perform nonlinear and   probabilistic dimensionality reduction. This work develops a flexible model class, called Gaussian     process latent variable flows (GPLVF), and evaluates its performance in massively missing data settings.</p>
