I"™<p>While excitement about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies continues to build, a gap is emerging between our aspirations for the benefits of AI and our ability to deploy these technologies to tackle real-world challenges. Achieving the full potential of AI â€“ and its benefits for society and the economy â€“ requires the ability to safely and effectively deploy AI systems at scale.  Research in this theme considers the advances in AI and system design that can manage the complex interactions that arise in real-world applications, from innovations in statistical emulation to software engineering for machine learning deployment.</p>
