I"”<p>While excitement about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies continues to build, a gap is emerging between our aspirations for the benefits of AI and our ability to deploy these technologies to tackle real-world challenges. Achieving the full potential of AI â€“ and its benefits for society and the economy â€“ requires the ability to safely and effectively deploy AI systems at scale.  Research in this theme considers the advances in AI and system design that can manage the complex interactions that arise in real-world applications, from innovations in statistical emulation to software engineering for machine learning deployment.
What advances are needed to ensure that AI systems operate safely and effectively in deployment?</p>

<p>A significant proportion of attempted AI deployments fail, highlighting a suite of practical issues that arise when trying to integrate AI into real-world systems â€“ from data management and use, to model performance, to user experience. These failures not only hold back the economic potential of AI, they also expose individuals, communities and societies to new forms of harm. Our AI deployment and system design research theme considers the interventions that can support safe and effective AI systems in real-world contexts.</p>

<p>Research in this theme considers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>systems and software engineering for machine learning deployment, investigating how new software and data architectures can support system adaptability, scalability, and autonomy;</li>
  <li>statistical emulation and hierarchical probabilistic modelling, exploring the role of emulation and simulation in improving AI system performance;</li>
  <li>what advances in modelling and system design can improve accuracy, robustness, safety and effectiveness, including real-time inference and decision-making; and</li>
  <li>AI applications in healthcare, science, and industry.</li>
</ul>
