I"’<p>This new initiative seeks to support Cambridge University researchers using AI in their research, by helping resolve engineering issues they might encounter when implementing machine learning methods.</p>

<p>Software engineering queries can arise across the research pipeline, from writing proposals to implementing and deploying models, and the Clinic will provide support to troubleshoot those issues.</p>

<p>When you contact the Clinic, an experienced Engineer can offer advice or guidance on how to resolve your query. Simply log your issue via the Clinicâ€™s form and one of the Clinicâ€™s engineers will follow-up to arrange a meeting to either further discuss the issue if needed or to discuss a potential solution.</p>
