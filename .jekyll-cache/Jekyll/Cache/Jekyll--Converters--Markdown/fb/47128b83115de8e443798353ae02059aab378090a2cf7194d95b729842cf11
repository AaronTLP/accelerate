I"Í<p>Solar photovoltaic technologies are vital for sustainable renewable energy. If weâ€™re to make photovoltaics as effective as possible, we need advanced nanomaterials that optimally harvest the Sunâ€™s electromagnetic spectrum. To design these materials, we need better understandings of the quantum dynamics and photo-physics at play. Machine learning can help develop these understandings by analysing high-dimensional datasets to reveal novel physics.</p>
