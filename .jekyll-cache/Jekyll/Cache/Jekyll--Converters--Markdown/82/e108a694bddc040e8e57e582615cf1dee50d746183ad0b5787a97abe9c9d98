I"u<p>Huge amounts of data are generated by modern microscopy and imaging studies. Our work helps researchers make sense of this data by visualising datasets in intuitive and immersive formats. This has applications across a range of domains, and our current work is investigating how doctors can make use of new software to analyse brain scans and prepare for surgeries.</p>
