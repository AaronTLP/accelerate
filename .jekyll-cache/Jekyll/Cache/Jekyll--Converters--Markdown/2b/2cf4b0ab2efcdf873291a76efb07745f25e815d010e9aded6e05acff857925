I"ó<p>My main area of theoretical interest is reality distortion in psychosis and its underlying neurocognitive and physiological mechanisms. My current work focuses on the application of computational models of reinforcement learning (RL) in patients with schizophrenia, in addition to investigating the link between RL task performance and molecular genetic risk for the disorder.</p>

<p>I am also interested in studying psychosis across different disorders, specifically Parkinsonâ€™s disease.</p>
