I"<p>I apply the principles and methods of psychology to understanding neural network behaviour.</p>

<p>I’m a machine learning PhD student in the ML@CL group at the University of Cambridge (Queens’ College), supervised by Prof. Neil Lawrence. During my master’s I worked on deep learning and natural language processing at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory. I did my bachelor’s in computer science at the University of Manchester, graduating 2013.</p>

<p>In between, I’ve also simulated financial crises in market risk at Goldman Sachs, built new retail banks at Thought Machine, and developed next generation credit scores at Credit Kudos.</p>

<p>I’m also the Founder and Chair of The Preptrack Foundation, a registered charity building technology for HIV prevention. Our first app, <a href="https://preptrack.co.uk/">Preptrack</a>, helps people who use PrEP, the medication that eliminates risk of HIV infection.</p>
