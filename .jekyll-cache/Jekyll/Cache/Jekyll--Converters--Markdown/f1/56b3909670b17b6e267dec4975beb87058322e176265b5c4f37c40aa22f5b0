I"h<p>The Schrödinger bridge problem was proposed in the 1930s by Erwin Scrödinger. It involves two probability distributions at a start time an end time. They are related by a dynamic process. Deciding the form of that dynamic process given these distributions is a challenging problem. In this work we provide a maximum likelihood approach to solving it.</p>
