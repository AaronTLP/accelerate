I"C<p>This paper analyses the phase diagram of water at three hybrid density-functional-theory levels of approximation. It demonstrates that it is possible to predict the phase diagram of a polymorphic system from first principles and provides a thermodynamic way of testing the limits of quantum-mechanical calculations.</p>
