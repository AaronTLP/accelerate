I"¸<p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) affects one in 10 critical care patients. It is a condition in which the lungs cannot provide the bodyâ€™s vital organs with enough oxygen, often as a result of infection. It is fairly common, but under-recognised and difficult to treat, partly due a lack of understanding of the underlying biology. Could machine learning help us identify more effective treatments for patients with ARDS?</p>
