I"ß<p>Understanding the proteome â€“ the set of proteins that a cell produces â€“ is crucial in understanding how a cell works, and (in the case of a disease-causing organism) developing effective treatments. One important way to understand the proteome is to study where proteins are found within a cell - known as spatial proteomics. Spatial proteomics can use machine learning methods with quantitative proteomic data to determine where proteins are localised within a cell.</p>
