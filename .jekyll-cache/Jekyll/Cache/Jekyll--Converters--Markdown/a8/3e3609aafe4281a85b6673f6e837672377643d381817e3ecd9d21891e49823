I"ö<p>By analysing complex datasets and uncovering previously unknown patterns, machine learning has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery across the sciences â€“ from healthcare to climate science, fundamental physics to conservation, and more. Realising this potential requires action to equip researchers from across disciplines with the skills they need to use machine learning in their work, and to build a community of practice at the interface of data science and other disciplines.</p>
