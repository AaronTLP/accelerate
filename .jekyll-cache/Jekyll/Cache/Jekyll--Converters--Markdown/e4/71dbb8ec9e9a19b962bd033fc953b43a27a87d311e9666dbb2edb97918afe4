I";<p>As machine learning is adopted across disciplines, scientists are faced with new software challenges related to implementing and maintaining machine learning models. These challenges are becoming a bottleneck to progress. In response, Accelerate Science’s software engineering programme will offer tailored software support to unblock these bottleneck.</p>

<p>Machine Learning Clinic: Accelerate’s Machine Learning Clinic offers expert advice to Cambridge University researchers using AI in their research, helping resolve engineering issues they might encounter when implementing machine learning methods.</p>

<p>Data Engineering for Science School: In December 2022, Accelerate is offering researchers at Cambridge University the opportunity to join an intensive 5-day Winter School on data science for science.</p>
