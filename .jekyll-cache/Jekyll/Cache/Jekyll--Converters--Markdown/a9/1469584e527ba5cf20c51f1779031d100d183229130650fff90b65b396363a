I"Ä<p>Though artificial intelligence is ubiquitous in our homes and workplaces, there is widespread misunderstanding of what it really is. Neil Lawrence gives the Strachey Lecture at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those machines to accommodate our needs. If we donâ€™t understand how those machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Much of the debate around AI makes the mistake of seeing machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. In this talk we argue that to control the machine we need to understand the machine, but to understand the machine we first need to understand ourselves.</p>
