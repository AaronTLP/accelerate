<p>Contributing to this work, led by Professor Neil Lawrence, this Human Cell Atlas project is creating a detailed single-cell and spatial atlas of embryos in late organogenesis. Its aim is to build an in-silico atlas of the human embryo. Its approach is to deploy machine learning approaches to large-scale dimensionality reduction, focusing on latent variable techniques such as GPLVM or variational auto-encoders.</p>
