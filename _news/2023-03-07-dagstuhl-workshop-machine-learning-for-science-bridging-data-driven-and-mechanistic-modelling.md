In September 2022, Accelerate partnered with the University of Tuebingen and the University of Wisconsin Madison to deliver a Dagstuhl workshop on ‘Machine learning for science: bridging data-driven and mechanistic modelling’.


This developed a research agenda that identifies areas where further technology development is needed to create AI tools for scientific discovery, and a roadmap for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to collaborate in support of a new wave of progress in AI for science. 

Two outputs emerged from these discussions:

* A research agenda that identifies areas where further technology development is needed to create AI tools that can enhance scientific discovery; and

* A roadmap for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to deliver a new wave of progress in AI and its application for scientific discovery.

*A﻿I for Science: An emerging agenda*, the report outlining this emerging agenda and roadmap is available [here](https://acceleratescience.github.io/assets/uploads/ai-for-science-an-emerging-agenda.pdf) and you can view a graphic summary of discussions [here.](https://acceleratescience.github.io/assets/uploads/2022-12-15-dagstuhl-ml-for-science-final-ipdf.pdf)
