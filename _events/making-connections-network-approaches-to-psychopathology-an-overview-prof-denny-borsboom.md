The Making Connections seminar series continues next week with a talk by Prof. Denny Borsboom, Professor of Psychology and director of the Social and Behavioral Data Science Centre at the University of Amsterdam. 

In the network approach to psychopathology, disorders are sets of causally connected symptoms. This conceptualization offers novel perspectives on the theoretical status of mental disorders: instead of cleanly separable categories that reflect central neural or psychological deficits, disorders are tightly connected regions in a symptom network. This conceptual framework suggests novel approaches to both the analysis of research data and the organization of treatment interventions, primarily through the application of network analysis: a set of techniques that offers powerful tools to study the dynamics of interconnected systems, to analyze the architecture of networks involving large numbers of entities (e.g., neurons, people, genes, variables), and to visualize connectivity structures in such networks. In the present talk, I will give an overview of the most important insights and results that have arisen from the network approach.

This talk is part of the [Making connections- brains and other complex systems](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/128590) series.
