We would like to invite the Accelerate community from across Cambridge to our first in-person networking event. Please join us to hear more from researchers applying data science to their research across the University.

The event will feature a series of flash talks from participants in previous Accelerate activities and a poster session with networking. To sign up please contactÂ [accelerate-science@cst.cam.ac.uk](mailto:accelerate-science@cst.cam.ac.uk).
