**This event is run by Dr Tobias Jackson, who was awarded funding through the Accelerate-Cambridge Centre for Data-Driven Discovery funding scheme in 2022.** 

We need to monitor trees over time to help us understand how they are responding to climate change. Can you help us by mapping trees? 

We will be using high-resolution aerial photographs covering Cambridgeshire as well as tropical forests in Borneo. We need your help manually outlining trees. Your efforts will be scored against other participants and against a state-of-the-art machine learning model. By participating in this project, you will be helping us improve our machine learning model and therefore predict how much carbon these trees will be able to store in the future.
