Dr. Konrad Wagstyl from the University College London will lead this seminar. The cerebral cortex exhibits a regionally varying microstructure which cannot be readily resolved using in vivo MRI. Nevertheless, cortical microstructure underpins many of the regional, developmental, and pathological changes we can measure in vivo. I will first present work done to create an atlas of cortical gene expression bridging the gap between micro and macro scales of cortical structure. I will then demonstrate the application and clinical translation of analyses of cortical microstructure to the detection of subtle cortical lesions causing epilepsy in the Multicentre Epilepsy Lesion Detection project.
