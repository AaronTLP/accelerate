title: Making Connections - Linking cortical microstructure to in vivo measures
  of cortical structure in health and disease - Dr. Konrad Wagstyl
start: February 1, 2023 5:56 AM
end: February 1, 2023 5:57 AM
desc: Dr. Konrad Wagstyl from the University College London will lead this
  seminar. The cerebral cortex exhibits a regionally varying microstructure
  which cannot be readily resolved using in vivo MRI. Nevertheless, cortical
  microstructure underpins many of the regional, developmental, and pathological
  changes we can measure in vivo. I will first present work done to create an
  atlas of cortical gene expression bridging the gap between micro and macro
  scales of cortical structure. I will then demonstrate the application and
  clinical translation of analyses of cortical microstructure to the detection
  of subtle cortical lesions causing epilepsy in the Multicentre Epilepsy Lesion
  Detection project.
